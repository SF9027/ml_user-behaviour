# Introduction

## Context

With the rapidly growth of the internet, online activities (such as online shopping) become more and more popular, e-commerce starts being an integral part of our lives. With so many unknown factors that come with not only selling but also providing good customer service, it is the key to success for companies to understand consumer preferences and behavior on the e-commerce platform in order to grow their business.

Therefore, our project aims to learn customers behavior based on the data collected from an online C2C fashion store launched in Europe around 2009 and to make a prediction of user latency in terms of improving user activities on e-commerce platform.

## Objective

The main purpose of our project is to predict whether users are latent on this platform, so that after this E-commerce platform can take measures to improve the user activities according to our research result.

# Planned Analysis

-- Supervised learning

o Models: KNN,Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Network

o Splitting strategy: cross validation-80% training set and 20% test set using stratified sampling (if the dataset is too large, we will reduce to 70% training set and 30% test set)

o Metrics: accuracy, sensitivity (recall), Confusion Matrix and AUC-ROC

-- Unsupervised learning: K-means clustering
