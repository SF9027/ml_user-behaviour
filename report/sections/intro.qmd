# Introduction

## Context

With the rapidly growth of the internet, online activities (such as online shopping) become more and more popular, e-commerce starts being an integral part of our lives. With so many unknown factors that come with not only selling but also providing good customer service, it is the key to success for companies to understand consumer preferences and behavior on the e-commerce platform in order to grow their business.

Therefore, our project aims to learn customers behavior based on the data collected from an online C2C fashion store launched in Europe around 2009 and to make a prediction of user latency in terms of improving user activities on e-commerce platform.

## Data Source

We found a dataset about the user behavior of "an online global C2C fashion store" from Kaggle Web.The dataset contains records on over 9 million registered users from this online store and subsequently expanded globally. The link of this dataset is "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-c2c-fashion-store-user-behaviour-analysis".


## Objective

The main purpose of our project is to predict whether users are latent on this platform, so that after this E-commerce platform can take measures to improve the user activities according to our research result.

# Data Description

## Features

o identifierHash: unique identifier for each transaction 

o daysSinceLastLogin: how many days the user is offline

o seniority: how long since the user registered

o HasAnyApp: user has applications

o HasAndroidApp: user has android application

o HasIosApp: user has IOS application

o Gender: gender of the users

o Language: language user prefer to use on this platform

o Country: user location

## The instances

The dataset contains user data of 98,912 instances, where each instance represents a user with a purchase record.

## Data Modification

We will use graphics and visualizations to explore and analyze the dataset (EDA) first and to see if we need to combine with another dataset (named: Buyers-repartition-by-country ), to try to link with user's country, topbuyers and other variables.

# Planned Analysis

-- Supervised learning

o Models: KNN,Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Network

o Splitting strategy: cross validation-80% training set and 20% test set using stratified sampling (if the dataset is too large, we will reduce to 70% training set and 30% test set)

o Metrics: accuracy, sensitivity (recall), Confusion Matrix and AUC-ROC

-- Unsupervised learning: K-means clustering
